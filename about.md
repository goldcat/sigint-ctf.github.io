Capture the Flag (CTF) is a competitive hacking game played by several teams,
who solve challenges and hack into designated machines to find the flag (key)
and get points. CTF challenges include web hacking, binary reverse engineering,
exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and many other security fields.

SIGINT is UC San Diego's CTF team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate
students, started in 2013.
